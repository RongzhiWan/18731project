{\bf Quick 4-5 sentence abstract of the work: 1. Motivate problem 2. What is known 3. What you propose to do that is different 4. Expected outcomes}

As Internet-of-things (IoT) gets more and more popularity, security issues of IoT device are gaining more attention. Device type identification is considered an important topic of IoT security for that device type can be exploited by many security approached to provide protection for IoT devices. Works have been done on extracting features from packet generated by the device and use those features for classification. This work is focused on improving classification accuracy by applying different feature engineering techniques on different traffic type. A general feature engineering strategy for IoT device type identification should be given as the contribution of the work.

\section{Problem Statement}

{\bf What is the problem that this project is going to address?
Does it matter: why is the problem important? Who will
benefit when the problem is solved}

{\bf Has your problem statement been updated or pivoted from the proposal? Why? Did you address comments 
from the feedback. 0.5 page}

Currently we are in the middle of the big trend of IoT. Connecting identifiable smart devices allowing them to exchange data has facilitated peoples life greatly. The number of IoT devices is estimated to reach 24 billion in 2020 [1]. However, an thriving area with such coverage and scale is not being paid sufficient attention with respect to security issues. The difficulty lies
in the inconsistent nature among different vendors or even among different products of the same vendor. There are no standard security design guidelines that can be followed by all IoT developers. On the other hand, vendors may not value the security issue enough to invest in such development, which makes the problem more difficult to be solved at the design phase of IoT devices. Another concern is that IoT devices have been widely deployed for personal and public uses. Therefore a solution that does not require change in existing IoT networks is being expected. One of the possible solutions is device-type identification, which this work will focus on.

This project will address the problem of device-type
identification. Solving this problem can help defend many attacks against IoT devices. Many IoT related attacks, including device compromising, data ex-filtration, and false information injection, can be characterized by unauthorized data transformation. These attacks can often be identified by noticing the difference between the device-type a device claims, and the device-type analyzed from its traffic.

Compared with proposal where our plan is to study type identification for wireless protocols, now we generalize our project by exploring a general feature engineering strategy -- not limiting to wired or wireless protocols only. In addition, we expect to study different time period of traffic (both setup phase and afterwards), and to collect more traffic by applying active monitoring.

\section{Related Work}
{\bf What is the state-of-art? Have you done a reasonable literature survey? How do you think 
your work will be different and/or better?}

{\bf 0.5 page}

Many works on IoT devices identification have been done. One of them is "IoT SENTINEL"[2]. This system is able to automatically identify the types of devices being connected to an IoT network, and to enable corresponding enforcement rules. This system is based on passively observed network traffic during the setup phase of smart home devices. After fingerprinting, devices can be classified by comparing the edit distance of their fingerprints.

Another related work is an analysis of Home IoT network traffic and behaviour[3]. In the setting a smart home, this work aims to understand the overall IO behaviour of devices, including protocol used, data volumes, type, data rate and transmission frequency, etc. Different from IoT SENTINEL, this analysis is based on a relatively long term traffic, including both setup phase and further communications. Also, different from IoT SENTINEL who adopts machine learning techniques, this work uses statistics-based analysis.

These works provide valuable insights and outcomes, yet there are some improvements can be done to better identify devices. One of them is feature selection: in IoT SENTINEL, 23 features are chosen, including the type of protocols used across different layers, packet header information, packet size and so on. In the analysis of home IoT network, it has chosen many features in common such as protocols and data volumes. It also selects different features like data rate and transmission frequency. In our work, in the setting of smart home, we will select more representative and distinguishable features based on a series of experiments. This is expected to yield a higher classification rate. In addition, IoT SENTINEL only analyze header data, without touching any of payload information. Yet many useful features can be found in payload. For example, a camera using plain HTTP without encryption may have some keyword "camera" "video" in HTTP messages. In our work, we value such information in payload. This gives us more information than just looking at headers.

Another improvement can be collecting more traffic. IoT SENTINEL captures device traffic during setup phase, and the home IoT network analysis captures a 22-day period. Both of them use passive monitoring, either by Wireshark sniffing or monitoring tools like Bro. In our work, we expect to try actively sending messages to IoT devices and observe their responses. This may provide more desired information, compared with passive monitoring.

\section{Preliminary results}

{\bf What has  been done to validate the early approach? (E.g.
measurements, simulations, constructing code)  0.5--1 page}

Currently we have completed initial implementation of all three components, feature extraction, random forest classifier and edit distance classifier. Further tuning and modification is still in progress. 

We also successfully generated device fingerprints from captured raw traffic, and transformed them to a ready-to-train format. The feature extractor, or data cleaner, is based on a Python library "dpkt" that can resolve Wireshark ".pcap" files. By examining packet data, such as IP addresses, port numbers and packet size, we were able to generate fingerprints that describe those features.

Our working repository, including captured data, cleaned data and implementation code can be found here: https://github.com/RongzhiWan/18731project
